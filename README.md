Exploratory Data Analysis Project 2

There are 6 R script files and 6 png plot image files for this project submission

For PA2Plot1.R and PA2Plot2.R I brute force the solution by calculating column sums individualy and then combine them in the final plot.

PA2Plot3-PA2Plot6 I started using crosstabs (xtabs function) to generate the column sums by year, which is of course more
elegant but requires some cleaning up of column labels and formats as well as converting the xtabs object into a normal data frame.

Anyway, plotting is pretty straight forward, getting the data correctly (or reasonably accurate) is dependent on some definitional issues (like vehicle emission vs. emission from paint or break wear on a vehicle should be included???)
My rationale and the verification of "reasonableness" of the subsetting criteria are documented in the comments of the appropriate R script.

Hope all is clear...

And thank you for taking the time...
